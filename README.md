# Reinforcement_Learning
My attempts at making RL agents

Dependencies for the CartPole-v0 problem are:

tensorflow 2

gym

numpy 


You can install them using the commands

```shell 
pip install tensorflow
pip install gym
pip install numpy
```
Please note that the default for your system may be Python 2.7 instead of Python 3. In that case please use ``` pip3 ``` instead of ``` pip ```.
Then go the directory where you wish to clone the repository.
```
git clone git@github.com:PratyushGupta0/Reinforcement_Learning.git
cd Reinforcement_Learning
cd CartPole-v0
python CartPole.py
```
Please note that the ```python``` command may default to python 2.7 , in that case use ```python3```.
